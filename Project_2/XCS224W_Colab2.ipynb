        "- When working with PyTorch and Neural Network models, understanding the shapes of different tensors, especially the input and output tensors is incredibly helpful.\n",
        "- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss. Remember to comment out / save the default number of epochs that we provide you.\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
